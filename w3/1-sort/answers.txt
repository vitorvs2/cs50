sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Performs well in sorted cases and worse as the complexity increases in random and reversed.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Performs well in all cases with a logaritimic pattern comparing the time X increase of problem complexity

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Performs well in less complex cases, and worse as the complexity increases, including sorted ones
