With this information about the averages of the top 100 songs of past year,
we see a prevalence of danceability over energy over valence, respectively.
Energy indicates the overall "speed" or "intensity" of a song
Valence indicates the overall "happiness" of a song
Danceability is self explanatory
The profile of a user based on the top 100 songs indicates a blue and purple
due to a balance of valence, but priorization of high danceability and energy.

This "diagnostic" is not very acurate because the indicators of valence
appear to be too restrictive into a song, since even songs with apparently
"low happiness" due to minor tones or things like that can instead be joyful,
depending of the situation.

One way to make this more precise would implement more parameters into analysing
not only the keys and variations, but even the lyrics effects on it.
